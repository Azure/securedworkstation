.SYNOPSIS
This script downloads, and installs the MMA agent (64 bit AMD processor). 
The MMA agent provide the required monitoring of a device APPLOCKER instance. 
This deployment is sample code to be used with the guidance at aka.ms/securedworkstation, using the Secure workstation profile.

The Secure workstation profile once loaded in Intune will enable all targeted devices to beging auditing all
DLL, EXE, MSI, and Store Apps of APPLOCKER events.


NOTE - this enables ALL informational applocker monitoring of DLL, EXE, MSI, and Store Apps. This WILL
generate large traffic to your Azure instance of your Log Analytics workspace. USE with caution.
